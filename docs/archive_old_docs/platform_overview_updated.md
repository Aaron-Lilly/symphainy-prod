One-Page Architecture Diagram Narrative
“How the SymphAIny Coexistence Fabric Works”

This is the voiceover someone should be able to read while looking at a single diagram.

SymphAIny Coexistence Fabric
Where work gets done
Harnessing AI to remove friction between people, processes, and systems.

The Core Idea
Enterprises don’t fail because they lack systems.
They fail because work has to cross boundaries — between people, legacy platforms, modern tools, and incomplete automation.

The SymphAIny Coexistence Fabric exists to govern and coordinate that boundary-crossing so work can move without forcing replacement, rewrites, or premature automation.

The Architecture, End-to-End
Work enters the fabric as intent.

An intent can come from:

a human (via UI, chat, upload, approval),

an agent (reasoned suggestion),

or an external system (API, batch, event).

1. Experience Systems — Where intent is expressed
Experience systems capture what someone is trying to accomplish, not how to do it.

UI, APIs, chat, streaming, external integrations

Humans are first-class actors

No execution, no policy, no orchestration

Output:

“Here is the work we want to happen.”

2. Civic Systems — How work is coordinated safely
Civic Systems are the behavioral backbone of the platform.

They define:

how work is composed,

how governance is applied,

how humans, agents, and systems participate together.

Key Civic Systems:
Solution System – defines end-to-end flows and compositions

Smart City – applies governance, policy, coordination patterns

Agentic System – enables reasoning, collaboration, and assistance

Curator – maintains shared understanding of what exists

This is where:

humans are routed into flows,

agents collaborate without executing,

legacy and modern systems are coordinated without being rewritten.

Output:

“This is the governed plan for how the work will proceed.”

3. Runtime Execution Engine — Where work actually happens
Runtime is the single execution authority.

It:

validates execution contracts,

applies final governance checks,

records state, lineage, and outcomes,

executes both automated steps and human handoffs.

Runtime does not decide what to do —
it ensures that whatever happens is auditable, replayable, and safe.

Output:

“This work happened — here is the evidence.”

4. Realm Services — Where domain work is performed
Realm Services do the actual domain-specific work:

Content

Insights

Journey

Outcomes

They:

execute deterministically,

rely on Civic Systems for coordination,

never bypass governance or Runtime.

The Result
The platform does not eliminate humans or legacy systems.

It integrates them into a governed, observable system of work.

Work moves forward even when:

automation is incomplete,

humans must intervene,

systems cannot be modernized yet.

That is the Coexistence Fabric.
