# Phase 5 Progress Summary

**Date:** January 25, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ **TASK 5.4 COMPLETE** - Ready for Tasks 5.2 and 5.1  
**Goal:** Become absolute platform experts before creating holistic 3D test suite

---

## Executive Summary

**Task 5.4 (Code Quality & Documentation) is complete!** We have achieved comprehensive platform expertise through systematic documentation of all intents, user journeys, data flows, and execution paths. This foundation enables us to proceed with Tasks 5.2 and 5.1, then design the holistic 3D test suite.

## ⏳ Task 5.2: Records of Fact Promotion - NEXT

**Status:** Ready to begin  
**Foundation:** Data lifecycle flow documented, promotion workflow designed

### Understanding Gained
- Promotion workflow designed
- Promotion criteria identified
- Storage locations documented

### Action Required
1. Audit current implementation
   - Find all embedding creation points
   - Find all interpretation creation points
   - Verify promotion status

2. Understand data architecture
   - Document four-class architecture
   - Map data transitions
   - Document storage locations

3. Verify/implement promotion
   - Ensure embeddings stored as Records of Fact
   - Ensure interpretations stored as Records of Fact
   - Test promotion workflow

**Estimated Time:** 4-7 hours

### Action Required
1. Understand TTL tracking
   - Find TTL tracking implementation
   - Document TTL model
   - Map TTL enforcement points

2. Design TTL enforcement
   - Design purge job
   - Design enforcement logic
   - Design testing strategy

3. Implement TTL enforcement
   - Create automated purge job
