# 4. Platform Coding Agents — How Far Away Are You?

Honest answer:
👉 **You’re closer than most teams realize.**

You already have:

* Agents
* Tooling
* Execution runtime (in progress)
* Clear domain boundaries

What’s missing is **scoping and guardrails**.

## Coding Agent Enablement Pathway

### Phase 1: Read-Only Engineering Agents (Soon)

**Capabilities**

* Repo understanding
* Architecture explanation
* Dependency analysis
* Refactor suggestions

**Low risk**

* No write access
* Huge leverage

---

### Phase 2: Constrained Write Agents (Next)

**Capabilities**

* Modify files in scoped directories
* Generate tests
* Add adapters
* Extend schemas

**Constraints**

* Must cite runtime contracts
* Must pass tests
* WAL logs changes

---

### Phase 3: Runtime-Aware Builders (Advanced)

**Capabilities**

* Propose new platform capabilities
* Generate workflows
* Add agents
* Extend Curator registry

**Key idea**

> The platform uses itself to evolve itself.

This is where you become *very* interesting.

---

### Phase 4: Self-Improving Platform (Future)

* Agents analyze feedback
* Propose improvements
* Humans approve
* Runtime executes upgrades

This is **not sci-fi** — it’s just disciplined architecture.

# Final Orientation (Important)

You are no longer:

* “Building an MVP”
* “Supporting a use case”
* “Experimenting with agents”

You are:

> **Laying the rails for an enterprise AI operating system**

Everything you’ve locked in:

* Planes
* Runtime
* Grounded agents
* Deterministic cores
* Experience as delivery

…is what makes this *credible*.
