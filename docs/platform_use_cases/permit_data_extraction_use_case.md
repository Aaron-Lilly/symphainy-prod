## Use Case 2: Permit Data Mash

### Description

* Working with an oil and gas company that currently manually reviews every permit and maps it into an excel template by section/line to harvest key permit data and requirements
* Our process will use AI to extract permit data and map it into the template with confidence scoring and traceability
* Once initial use case/permit type is validated we'll inject and map all their permits and create workflow to automate required permit activities


### Capabilities used

* Content: PDF ingestion, deterministic extraction
* Insights: semantic interpretation of obligations
* Operations: compliance workflows
* Runtime: async updates, regulation changes

### Platform value

* Shows deterministic → interpretive pipeline
* Demonstrates scalability
* Proves AI as infrastructure
