- Roadmap generation (strategic roadmap with timeline and milestones)
- POC proposal creation (Proof of Concept proposals)
- Blueprint creation (coexistence blueprints from workflows)
- Cross-pillar integration (integrate and visualize work across all realms)
- Artifact export (JSON, DOCX, YAML)

**Journeys:**
- Outcome Synthesis
- Roadmap Generation
- POC Proposal Creation
- Blueprint Creation
- Solution Creation
- Artifact Export

## Contract Completeness

All realm solution contracts include:
- [x] Business Objective (Problem Statement, Target Users, Success Criteria)
- [x] Solution Composition (Composed Journeys, Journey Orchestration)
- [x] User Experience Flows (Primary, Alternative, Error Flows)
- [x] Non-Functional Requirements (Performance, Security, Compliance)
- [x] Solution Components (All 6 components: Security, Control Tower, Coexistence, Policies, Experiences, Business Logic)
- [x] Solution Artifacts (Artifacts Produced, Artifact Relationships)
- [x] Integration Points (Platform Services, Civic Systems, External Systems)
- [x] Testing & Validation (Business Acceptance Criteria, UAT, Contract-Based Testing)
- [x] Solution Registry (Solution Metadata, Journey Dependencies, Solution Dependencies)
- [x] Coexistence Component (GuideAgent Integration, Liaison Agents, Conversation Topics)
- [x] Evolution & Roadmap (Current Version, Planned Enhancements)

---

## Implementation Status

All 4 realm solutions are **IMPLEMENTED** based on actual codebase:
- Content Realm: File upload, parsing, embedding creation workflows
- Insights Realm: Quality assessment, semantic embeddings, discovery, relationship mapping, business analysis
- Journey Realm: Workflow/SOP management, visualization, conversion, coexistence analysis
- Outcomes Realm: Outcome synthesis, roadmap generation, POC proposal creation, blueprint creation

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All 4 realm solution contracts created
2. ⏳ Create journey contracts for each realm solution
3. ⏳ Create intent contracts for each journey
4. ⏳ Validate contracts for completeness and consistency
5. ⏳ Ready for agents to build solution components
